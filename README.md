# Tool Ahead Of Time: Because Why Wait?
Ever found yourself staring at a shiny new LLM through Langchain's window, but can't use tool calling because it's "not supported yet"? 

*Sad react-agent noises* 😢

Well, hold my JSON parser, because this repo says "NOT TODAY!" 🦾

## What is this sorcery? 🧙‍♂️

This is a Python package that enables tool calling for any model available through Langchain's ChatOpenAI library (and by extension, any model available through the base OpenAI's library), even before LangChain and LangGraph officially supports it! 

Yes, you read that right. We're living in the age of AI and things move fast 🏎️💨

Currently showcasing with DeepSeek-R1. Because why should we wait for official support when we can have tool calling TODAY?

## Features 🌟

- Tool calling support for any model available through Langchain's ChatOpenAI library (and by extension, any model available through OpenAI's library)
- Handles conversation history like a pro
- More robust than a caffeinated developer at 3 AM
- Zero waiting for official support required

## Quick Start 🚀

## Disclaimer ⚠️

This package is like that friend who shows up to the party early - technically not invited yet, but hopes to bring such good vibes that everyone's glad they came.

## License 📜
